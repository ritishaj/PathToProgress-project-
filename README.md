# Path to Progress 

## *the fitbit for your mind :D*

#### Path to Progress is an application that will allow its users to track their academic progress for their courses throughout the semester. 
Bombed your math midterm? Thinking of dropping out because of this insane failure? It's not the end of the world! Path to Progress is the perfect app for users to strategize exactly how to bounce back with concrete numbers and data. Whether you have a certain academic goal in mind, or you just want to pass the class, Path to Progress will lay out the **path** for you (* *pun intended*).  

I picked this project to design a system for students to have a record of all their little successes and failure, hopefully gaining motivation as they see their progress throughout the course. The same way workout apps track physical fitness, Path to Progress tracks your *mental fitness*.
